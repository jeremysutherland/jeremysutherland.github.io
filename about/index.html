As biologists, we understand that genomics are fundamental to understanding living organisms. That is why I've devoted much of my career towards the goal of protecting and improving agricultural crops at the molecular level. While working with the USDA, I designed diagnostic tests that were used to safeguard US agriculture from the spread of disease. As a graduate student at Penn State, I explore the relationships between crop genomes and their associated microbiomes towards the goal of improved yields.

I see this as important and vital work. Globally, safe and reliable food supplies are becoming a luxury. Too many of us take the food supply chain for granted and, due to climate change and exponential population growth, we don't have much time to ensure that that trend doesn't become the norm. This is what motivates me as a researcher. The hopes that we can leverage agriculture beyond its present day limits and collectively solve the problem of feeding everyone remains at the forefront of my daily priorities.
  
I was President of the Science Policy Society at Penn State from 2019-2020. I accepted the Student Leader Scholarship for creating opportunities for our members allowing them to become better science communicators and advocacy leaders. This was a great honor and I am proud to have contributed to the Penn State Community in this way. I'm currently a policy assistant with Pasa Sustainable Agriculture, a non-profit based in Pennsylvania.

In my past life, I was a recording engineer for the Chicago Recording Company and an avid musician. A failed job opportunity stemming from this career led me to study biology in college and the rest is history!

I am also a loving father and husband. These two are the reason I strive for better in all I do.
