I am interested in the genetic relationships between hosts and their associated microbiomes across different environments.
----------------------------------------------------------

I investigate topics related to:

* Host-microbe-environment interactions
* Host genetic influence on microbiome composition
* Conservation in microbial niche space 
* Microbial functional redundancy across environments
* Host evolutionary responses to microbes (and vice versa)
