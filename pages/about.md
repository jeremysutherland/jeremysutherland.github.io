As biologists, we understand that genomics are fundamental to understanding living organisms. That is why I've devoted much of my career towards understanding the relationships between plants and their environment at the molecular level. As an undergraduate, I studied the role of herbivory and environmental restoration on the population structure of native plant populations at both the University of Illinois – Chicago and the Chicago Botanic Garden. While working for the USDA, I designed molecular diagnostic tests that were used to safeguard US agriculture from the spread of disease. As a PhD. candidate at Penn State, I explore the relationships between crop genomes and their associated microbiomes towards the goal of increasing agriculture sustainability.

My passion for sustainable agriculture extends beyond the bench as well. I am currently a Fellow at the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR). The FFAR Fellows Program is a training hub focused on building science communication, networking, and leadership skills. I also serve as a Policy  Assistant with Pasa Sustainable Agriculture, a non-profit based in Pennsylvania, USA. Pasa's mission is to promote sustainable agriculture practices through education, outreach, and research. I work with Pasa’s policy strategist to promote and advocate for state and federal sustainable agriculture policy initiatives. In 2019, I was President of the Penn State Science Policy Society, a graduate organization dedicated to bridging the gaps between science and public policy.

I am an award winning researcher and student. I received the Elmer Hadley award for my undergraduate research thesis and the B.J. Hoddinott Scholarship for my academic achievements. I received the Student Leader Scholarship from Penn State for my work as President of the Science Policy Society and a nomination for Outstanding Officer of the Year. More recently, I won the FFAR Fellows Professional Development Scholarship and FFAR’s annual lighting talk competition (2021). In addition to these I have won multiple travel grants to attend research conferences and meetings.

In my past life, I was a recording engineer for the Chicago Recording Company and an avid musician. A failed job opportunity stemming from this career led me to study biology in college and the rest is history!

I am a loving father and husband. These two are the reason I strive for better in all I do.
