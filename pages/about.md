As biologists, we know that genetics are fundamental to understanding living organisms. That is why I have devoted much of my career to understanding the relationships between plants and their environment at the molecular level. Presently, I am a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Summer Postdoctoral Research Fellow. As part of a cultural and scientific exchange, I studied plant virology and strategies for integrated pest management (IPM) at Hosei University in Tokyo, Japan. I was honored to present my graduate research at both Hosei University and The University of Tokyo. 

As an undergraduate, I studied the role of herbivory and environmental restoration on the population structure of native plant populations at both the University of Illinois – Chicago and the Chicago Botanic Garden. While working for the USDA, I designed molecular diagnostic tests that were used to safeguard US agriculture from the spread of disease. As a Ph.D. candidate at Penn State, I explore the relationships between crop genomes and their associated microbiomes toward the goal of increased agricultural sustainability. 

My passion for sustainable agriculture extends beyond the bench as well. As a graduate student, I was a fellow at the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR). The FFAR Fellows Program is a training hub focused on building science communication, networking, and leadership skills. I also serve as a Policy  Assistant with Pasa Sustainable Agriculture, a non-profit based in Pennsylvania, USA. Pasa's mission is to promote sustainable agriculture practices through education, outreach, and research. I work with Pasa’s policy strategist to promote and advocate for state and federal sustainable agriculture policy initiatives. In 2019, I was President of the Penn State Science Policy Society, a graduate organization dedicated to bridging the gaps between science and public policy.

I am an award-winning researcher and student. I received the Elmer Hadley Award for my undergraduate research thesis and the B.J. Hoddinott Scholarship for my academic achievements. I received the Student Leader Scholarship from Penn State for my work as President of the Science Policy Society and a nomination for Outstanding Officer of the Year. I won the FFAR Fellows Professional Development Scholarship and FFAR’s annual lighting talk competition ([2021](https://ffarfellows.org/ffar-fellows-lightning-talks-2021/)). In addition to these I have won multiple travel grants to attend research conferences and meetings.
  
I am a loving father and husband. These two are the reason I strive for better in all I do.
