As biologists, we understand that genomics are fundamental to understanding living organisms. That is why I've devoted much of my career towards the goal of protecting and improving agricultural crops at the molecular level. While working with the USDA, I designed diagnostic tests that were used to safeguard US agriculture from the spread of disease. As a graduate student at Penn State, I explore the relationships between crop genomes and their associated microbiomes towards the goal of improved yields.

I see this as important and vital work. Globally, safe and reliable food supplies are becoming a luxury. Too many of us take the food supply chain for granted and, due to climate change and exponential population growth, we don't have much time to ensure that that trend doesn't become the norm. This is what motivates me as a researcher. The hopes that we can leverage agriculture beyond its present day limits and collectively solve the problem of feeding everyone remains at the forefront of my daily priorities.
