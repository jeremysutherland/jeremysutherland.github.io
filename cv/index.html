RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
Dissertation, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA
2023
Advisor: Dr. Jesse Lasky, Dr. Terrence Bell
Project: Breeding resilient, disease-resistant switchgrass cultivars for marginal lands
C-REEMS Grant Proposal Number: 2018-05922

Summary: I leverage computational methods to better understand the relationships
between plant host traits and their associated soil microbiome compositions in
different environments. In agriculture, the host-microbiome relationship is vital to a
crop’s health and performance. My research innovates by combining host genotypic
information with microbial and environmental information to more accurately predict
switchgrass outcomes in the Northeastern United States.

Skills: Data collection (rhizosphere soil), host phenotyping, DNA extraction from
soils, 16s/ITS sequencing library prep, Bioinformatics, FASTQ processing,
microbiome diversity analysis, microbial phylogenetics, host SNP variant calling,
genome-wide association survey, statistical analyses, database management, genomic
selection, predictive modeling, HPC computing, R, python, bash, Linux
North Carolina State University – USDA, Beltsville, MD
2017 to 2018

Research Assistant, USDA APHIS PPQ
Advisor: Dr. Kurt Zeller

Summary: I developed and validated molecular methods for diagnosing regulatory
plant pathogens for the United States Dept. of Agriculture (USDA). I developed in-
house bioinformatic pipelines for the identification of molecular markers for species-
specific pathogen detection. I completed genome assemblies and analysis of high-
consequence pathogenic fungal species. ISO/IEC 17025:2005 certified and BSL-3
work environment.

Skills: Wet lab, fungal culturing, DNA extraction, WGS sequencing and library prep,
Bioinformatics, FASTQ processing, de novo genome assembly, BLAST, PCR primer
design, PCR target bacterial cloning, qPCR methods development and validation,
database management, routine lab maintenance and reporting

University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL
2015 to 2016
Undergraduate Researcher
Advisor: Dr. Mary Ashley

Summary: I researched the effects of herbivory on the genetic population structure of
Clintonia borealis utilizing next-generation sequencing.

Skills: DNA extraction from plant tissue, DNA sequencing and library prep, micro-
satellite analysis, routine lab maintenance and reporting

Award: The Elmer Hadley Award is given to a student with high academic
achievement who has carried out an outstanding research project in the area of
ecology, evolution, or conservation biology.

University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL
2015 to 2015
Undergraduate Research Assistant
Advisor: Dr. Scott Franzblau

Summary: I provided technical lab support including protein induction and
purification, conventional PCR and analysis, anti-mycobacterial susceptibility testing,
sample shipping and storage, routine lab maintenance and equipment calibration.

The Chicago Botanic Garden, Glencoe, IL
2015 to 2015
REU Intern
Advisor: Dr. Jeremie Fant

Summary: I provided technical lab support to a project investigating the effects of
source genetic material on plant reintroduction efforts.
Skills: DNA extraction from plant tissue, conventional PCR, DNA fragment analysis
and scoring.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE
The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA
Aug. 2021 to Dec. 2021
Graduate Teaching Assistant, Biology Department
Biology 110, Lab Sections: 007 and 047

Bio 110 is an undergraduate lab course averaging 20 students per lab section,
covering the following topics: observing biological diversity, experimental design and
hypothesis development, evaluating experimental evidence, developing strong
laboratory techniques

I developed and graded quizzes, exams, and homework.I prepared and gave a ~1 hour lab lecture and then advised students on their lab work
for the remainder of the time (up to 3 hours).

The United States Dept. of Agriculture, Beltsville, MD
Aug 2018
Workshop Coordinator
I prepared materials for and co-lead a multi-day bioinformatics workshop. I prepared materials for and assisted a multi-day Phytophthora ramorum diagnostics
workshop.

PROFESSIONAL AFFILIATIONS
The Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, 2020-2023
Fellow

The FFAR Fellows Program is focused on building communication, networking, and
leadership skills for fellows working in the agriculture sector. I participated in several of
FFAR’s science communication and professional development workshops. In 2021, I won
FFAR's annual lightning talk competition by incorporating what I have learned during the
fellowship.

Pasa Sustainable Agriculture, 2021-Present
Policy and Special Projects Assistant

I engage with decision makers to promote and advocate for state and federal sustainable
agriculture policy initiatives. Pasa co-sponsors my fellowship at the Foundation for Food and
Agriculture Research.

Science Policy Society at Penn State, 2019-2022
President

I engaged with decision makers to promote and advocate for state and federal policy
initiatives that support scientific research. I organized and attended the Alan Alda Science
Communication Workshop and two AAAS Policy Writing Workshops. I co-organized our
monthly Science On-Tap science outreach program. I produced and edited several of the
“Sci-Pol Connect” podcast episodes. I hosted a number of panels at Penn State related to
science communication and policy.
